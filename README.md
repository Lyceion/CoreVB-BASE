**IMPORTANT!**
This SDK is still work in progress so be patient...

------------

###### ## How To Use?
So easy to use. Example Code For CSGO AntiFlash;
```vb
Dim LocalPlayer As Integer = ClientDLL + &HCF1A3C
While True
	Memory.WriteFloat(LocalPlayer + &HA3F0, 0)
End While
```
`Note: Pointers are only working for 20.05.2019`

Write this codes to main and ta daaa! It is working!

------------

###### ## Is It Detectable?
Theoriticly, it is not if you change process information, title and add junk codes. But be careful! I'm not responsible any bans because of this base. Why? Because this is public base and you will carry all responsibilities about your cheats. 

------------

##### Programmer s Notes:
`Base is not complated yet so stay triggered for any updates. Don't forget to credit if you are making cheats with this base. Thanks for everything good bye!`
